A real-time sign language recognition system built with Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, TensorFlow, and cvzone.  
The project enables gesture-based communication by detecting and classifying hand signs captured through a webcam.

## Overview

This repository includes tools for:
- Capturing and preprocessing hand gesture images  
- Training and deploying a gesture classification model  
- Running real-time inference using a Keras model optimized for Apple Silicon  

The model recognizes a predefined set of gestures such as “Hello,” “Yes,” and “Thank you.”
